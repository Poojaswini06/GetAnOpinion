Get An Opinion is a full-stack telehealth application built to help patients receive quick, preliminary feedback about their symptoms before deciding to visit a doctor. The goal is to reduce misinformation from unverified online sources and provide a structured, private channel for users to describe their concerns and get a professional opinion.

ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement
Many individuals rely on online search engines or forums to self-diagnose, which can lead to anxiety or misinformation. Get An Opinion aims to solve this by offering a safe platform where users can input their symptoms and receive an opinion from a healthcare provider or systemâ€”bridging the gap between early concern and professional consultation.
